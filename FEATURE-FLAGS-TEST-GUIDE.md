# Feature Flags Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for testing the feature flag system for the Japanese-Cyberpunk enhancements. Feature flags allow for gradual rollout and easy enabling/disabling of features.

## Quick Start

### 1. Automated Test Script

Run the automated test script to generate different configurations:

```bash
node scripts/test-feature-flags.js
```

This will:
- Backup your current `.env.local`
- Generate 4 test configurations
- Provide instructions for manual verification
- Show a testing checklist

### 2. Manual Configuration

Edit `.env.local` and set feature flags:

```bash
# Enable all features
VITE_FEATURE_KANJI=true
VITE_FEATURE_GLITCH=true
VITE_FEATURE_HOLO=true
VITE_FEATURE_TRANSITIONS=true
VITE_FEATURE_CIRCUITS=true
VITE_FEATURE_PARALLAX=true
VITE_FEATURE_TYPOGRAPHY=true
VITE_FEATURE_LOADERS=true
VITE_FEATURE_EASTER_EGGS=true
VITE_FEATURE_ENHANCED_UI=true
```

### 3. Restart Dev Server

After changing flags, restart the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Test Configurations

### Configuration 1: All Features OFF (Baseline)

**Purpose:** Verify site works without enhancements

```bash
VITE_FEATURE_KANJI=false
VITE_FEATURE_GLITCH=false
VITE_FEATURE_HOLO=false
VITE_FEATURE_TRANSITIONS=false
VITE_FEATURE_CIRCUITS=false
VITE_FEATURE_PARALLAX=false
VITE_FEATURE_TYPOGRAPHY=false
VITE_FEATURE_LOADERS=false
VITE_FEATURE_EASTER_EGGS=false
VITE_FEATURE_ENHANCED_UI=false
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Site loads without errors
- ‚úÖ No visual enhancements visible
- ‚úÖ All basic functionality works
- ‚úÖ Standard page transitions (no wipe effect)
- ‚úÖ Standard loaders (no torii)
- ‚úÖ No kanji particles in background
- ‚úÖ No glitch effects
- ‚úÖ No holographic cards
- ‚úÖ No easter eggs

**Verification Steps:**
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Navigate through all pages
3. Check browser console - should show all flags as ‚ùå
4. Verify no console errors
5. Test all forms and interactions
6. Check mobile view

### Configuration 2: All Features ON (Full Enhancement)

**Purpose:** Verify all features work together

```bash
VITE_FEATURE_KANJI=true
VITE_FEATURE_GLITCH=true
VITE_FEATURE_HOLO=true
VITE_FEATURE_TRANSITIONS=true
VITE_FEATURE_CIRCUITS=true
VITE_FEATURE_PARALLAX=true
VITE_FEATURE_TYPOGRAPHY=true
VITE_FEATURE_LOADERS=true
VITE_FEATURE_EASTER_EGGS=true
VITE_FEATURE_ENHANCED_UI=true
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Kanji particles visible in background
- ‚úÖ Particles form torii shape
- ‚úÖ Glitch effects on logo hover
- ‚úÖ Holographic shimmer on cards
- ‚úÖ Page transitions with wipe effect
- ‚úÖ Circuit lines in sections
- ‚úÖ Kanji prefixes on section titles
- ‚úÖ Torii loader when loading
- ‚úÖ Easter eggs functional (Konami code, triple-click)
- ‚úÖ Button ripple effects
- ‚úÖ Badge kanji

**Verification Steps:**
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Check browser console - should show all flags as ‚úÖ
3. Hover over logo - should see glitch effect
4. Navigate between pages - should see wipe transition
5. Hover over project cards - should see holographic effect
6. Try Konami code (‚Üë‚Üë‚Üì‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí‚Üê‚ÜíBA) - should see matrix rain
7. Triple-click logo - should see torii animation
8. Check mobile view - should see reduced effects
9. Monitor FPS in DevTools (target: 60fps desktop, 40+ mobile)

### Configuration 3: Core Features Only

**Purpose:** Test essential enhancements without heavy effects

```bash
VITE_FEATURE_KANJI=false
VITE_FEATURE_GLITCH=true
VITE_FEATURE_HOLO=false
VITE_FEATURE_TRANSITIONS=false
VITE_FEATURE_CIRCUITS=false
VITE_FEATURE_PARALLAX=false
VITE_FEATURE_TYPOGRAPHY=true
VITE_FEATURE_LOADERS=true
VITE_FEATURE_EASTER_EGGS=false
VITE_FEATURE_ENHANCED_UI=true
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Glitch effects enabled
- ‚úÖ Typography enhancements enabled
- ‚úÖ Custom loaders enabled
- ‚úÖ Enhanced UI enabled
- ‚ùå No kanji particles
- ‚ùå No holographic cards
- ‚ùå No page transitions
- ‚ùå No circuit lines
- ‚ùå No parallax
- ‚ùå No easter eggs

**Verification Steps:**
1. Verify only enabled features are visible
2. Check disabled features are not present
3. Verify no console errors
4. Test performance (should be better than full enhancement)

### Configuration 4: Gradual Rollout (Phase 2)

**Purpose:** Simulate gradual rollout scenario

```bash
VITE_FEATURE_KANJI=false
VITE_FEATURE_GLITCH=true
VITE_FEATURE_HOLO=true
VITE_FEATURE_TRANSITIONS=false
VITE_FEATURE_CIRCUITS=true
VITE_FEATURE_PARALLAX=false
VITE_FEATURE_TYPOGRAPHY=true
VITE_FEATURE_LOADERS=true
VITE_FEATURE_EASTER_EGGS=false
VITE_FEATURE_ENHANCED_UI=true
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Mix of enabled and disabled features
- No conflicts between features
- Smooth degradation for disabled features

**Verification Steps:**
1. Verify feature combination works correctly
2. Check no errors from disabled features
3. Test all enabled features function properly

3. Hard reload (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Console errors

**Solution:**
1. Check feature flag syntax (must be 'true' or 'false' as strings)
2. Verify all required components are imported
3. Check for missing dependencies

### Issue: Performance degradation

**Solution:**
1. Disable heavy features (kanji, parallax)
2. Check for memory leaks
3. Verify GPU acceleration is working
4. Test on different devices

### Issue: Features not visible

**Solution:**
1. Check feature flag is set to 'true'
2. Verify component is conditionally rendered
3. Check CSS is not hiding elements
4. Verify no JavaScript errors

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected:

1. **Immediate Rollback:**
   ```bash
   # Set problematic flag to false
   VITE_FEATURE_PROBLEMATIC=false
   
   # Restart dev server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Full Rollback:**
   ```bash
   # Set all flags to false
   # Edit .env.local and set all to false
   
   # Or restore backup
   cp .env.local.backup .env.local
   
   # Restart dev server
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Investigate:**
