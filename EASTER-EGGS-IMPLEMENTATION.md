## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Konami Code:**
   ```
   Press: ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A
   Expected: Matrix rain appears
   Wait 10s or press ESC to dismiss
   ```

2. **Triple-Click Logo:**
   ```
   Triple-click the KAINET logo in navbar
   Expected: Torii animation appears with message
   Click anywhere to dismiss
   ```

3. **Special Dates:**
   ```
   Temporarily modify date check in easterEggs.js
   Or wait for actual dates (01-01 or 10-13)
   Expected: Sakura petals or fireworks appear
   ```

4. **localStorage Tracking:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.getItem('kainet_easter_eggs')
   // Should show: ["konami", "tripleClick", etc.]
   ```

### Build Verification
```bash
npm run build
# ✅ Build successful with no errors
# ✅ All components properly code-split
```
